# This mini-project is based on the K-Means exercise from 'R in Action'
# Go here for the original blog post and solutions
# http://www.r-bloggers.com/k-means-clustering-from-r-in-action/

# Exercise 0: Install these packages if you don't have them already

install.packages(c("cluster", "rattle.data","NbClust"))

# Now load the data and look at the first few rows
data(wine, package="rattle.data")
head(wine)

# Exercise 1: Remove the first column from the data and scale
# it using the scale() function

df <- scale(wine[-1])

# Now we'd like to cluster the data using K-Means. 
# How do we decide how many clusters to use if you don't know that already?
# We'll try two methods.

# Method 1: A plot of the total within-groups sums of squares against the 
# number of clusters in a K-means solution can be helpful. A bend in the 
# graph can suggest the appropriate number of clusters. 

wssplot <- function(data, nc=15, seed=1234){
	              wss <- (nrow(data)-1)*sum(apply(data,2,var))
               	      for (i in 2:nc){
		        set.seed(seed)
	                wss[i] <- sum(kmeans(data, centers=i)$withinss)}
	                
		      plot(1:nc, wss, type="b", xlab="Number of Clusters",
	                        ylab="Within groups sum of squares")
}

wssplot(df)

# Exercise 2:
#   * How many clusters does this method suggest?
#        From wssplot(df), this method suggests 6 or 7 clusters.  
#   * Why does this method work? What's the intuition behind it?
#        Looking at the graph, after 6 or 7 clusters there is not much of difference and they look almost similar.   
#   * Look at the code for wssplot() and figure out how it works
#   Number of clusters are looking similar when the within groups sum of squares is low.


# Method 2: Use the NbClust library, which runs many experiments
# and gives a distribution of potential number of clusters.

library(NbClust)
set.seed(1234)
nc <- NbClust(df, min.nc=2, max.nc=15, method="kmeans")
barplot(table(nc$Best.n[1,]),
	          xlab="Numer of Clusters", ylab="Number of Criteria",
		            main="Number of Clusters Chosen by 26 Criteria")


# Exercise 3: How many clusters does this method suggest?
# K means method suggests 3 clusters.

# Exercise 4: Once you've picked the number of clusters, run k-means 
# using this number of clusters. Output the result of calling kmeans()
# into a variable fit.km

 fit.km <- kmeans(df, 3, nstart=25)
 
# Now we want to evaluate how well this clustering does.

# Exercise 5: using the table() function, show how the clusters in fit.km$clusters
# compares to the actual wine types in wine$Type. Would you consider this a good
# clustering?
str(fit.km)
table(fit.km$cluster)
table(fit.km$size)
table(fit.km$centers)
aggregate(df, by=list(cluster=fit.km$cluster), mean)
table(wine$Type)
table(fit.km$cluster,wine$Type)
# Yes I consider this as good clustering. Wines are clustered based on their type.
# Cluster 2 is an exception as the type is different for couple of observations.

# Exercise 6:
# * Visualize these clusters using  function clusplot() from the cluster library
# * Would you consider this a good clustering?
library(cluster)
clusplot(pam(df,3), main = "Clusplot Cluster")
# Yes clustering looks good and clearly seperated. 

# randindex
install.packages("flexclust")
library(flexclust)
table.kmeans <- table(wine$Type, fit.km$cluster)
randIndex(table.kmeans)
# Value is closer to 1 and shows good significance between types and clusters.
